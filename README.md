This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict loan default within the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) scheme, crucial for improving credit risk assessment in microfinance. Leveraging a dataset of 105,000 loan records and 26 features (including loan specifics like Loan Approved Gross, Gross Amount Disbursed, and institutional data like Name Of Bank), the analysis involves extensive EDA, data preprocessing (handling class imbalance via techniques like SMOTE), and the training of multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost). The ultimate goal is to deliver a highly accurate predictive tool that specifically optimizes Recall (minimizing missed defaults) to help financial institutions make better-informed decisions and mitigate Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).
